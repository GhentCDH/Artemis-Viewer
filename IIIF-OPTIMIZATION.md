# IIIF Layer Rendering — Optimization Context

This document exists to give a research agent full context on the current architecture, what has been attempted, what the performance problem is, and what we are looking for.

---

## What the application is

**Artemis** is a SvelteKit + MapLibre GL JS viewer for historical Belgian maps. Users browse a timeline of map collections (Gereduceerd Kadaster, Primitief Kadaster, etc.) and toggle layers on/off. Each IIIF layer contains hundreds of georeferenced map sheets covering Belgium.

The stack:
- **MapLibre GL JS** — the map renderer
- **Allmaps** (`@allmaps/maplibre`) — renders georeferenced IIIF images as a `WarpedMapLayer` (custom MapLibre layer, WebGL-based mesh warping)
- **IIIF image servers** — serve the actual tile pixels on demand

---

## How it works today — high-level overview

When a user activates an IIIF layer the app shows a **pre-warped raster tile pyramid** almost instantly, and only loads the expensive **Allmaps mesh-warping** once the user zooms in far enough to need it. Three independent, statically-served data products back this — all produced by the data pipeline (`Artemis-RnD-Data`) and consumed in the browser with no server at runtime:

1. **Raster tile pyramid** (`{z}/{x}/{y}.webp`, z8–12) — the whole collection mosaicked and pre-rectified into Web Mercator tiles. This is the **base renderer**: a native MapLibre `raster` source, visible the moment the layer is toggled on. Visually indistinguishable from Allmaps at overview/mid zoom.
2. **Geomaps bundle** (`<Collection>_geomaps.json`) — the georeferencing annotations (GCPs) + sprite-atlas refs for every canvas. Drives Allmaps' high-fidelity warped rendering. Fetched **eagerly** (it doubles as the click index), but the triangulation it feeds is **deferred**.
3. **Vector masks** (`<name>_masks.pmtiles`) — one clickable polygon per canvas for hover/click hit-testing. Independent of Allmaps, so canvases are clickable the instant the layer loads.

Lifecycle of one activation:

- **t0 — tiles + masks + bundle:** add the (empty) `WarpedMapLayer`, the raster tile source **beneath** it (base layer), and the mask fill layer on top; kick off the bundle fetch. The raster preview paints within ~one request round-trip.
- **overview browsing:** the raster pyramid is the sole visible renderer (the `WarpedMapLayer` above it is empty/transparent). **No triangulation happens** — panning is free.
- **zoom past 12.5 (`ALLMAPS_TRIGGER_ZOOM`):** viewport-driven loading starts — only the canvases whose footprint intersects the viewport (+ margin) are triangulated, nearest-first; then a `moveend` listener reconciles again on every settle. Allmaps renders these at full IIIF resolution in the `WarpedMapLayer` **above** the raster base, so the sharp warp occludes the raster where loaded and the raster shows through only where it hasn't. Loaded canvases are kept (no eviction), so panning back is instant.
- **toggle off:** the group (raster base + Allmaps meshes + masks) is fully removed. A later re-show re-inits cheaply — raster + masks are instant and only the current viewport re-triangulates, not the whole collection.

Two supporting mechanisms keep this clean:
- **`iiiftiles://` protocol** gates raster tile requests against the pyramid's `tiles_manifest.json` so tiles outside the irregular coverage are answered with a transparent image locally, never hitting the network (no 404 flood).
- **Step logging** — every stage logs `[IIIF <layer> · <pane>] … Nms` so the whole pipeline (tiles → bundle → zoom trigger → warp batches) is profilable in the console.

The rest of this document expands each piece, then records the history (gr_sprites attempts) that led here.

## Background: the original eager-Allmaps pipeline (superseded)

> Historical context. This is how activation worked before the raster-pyramid + lazy-Allmaps rewrite. The Allmaps mechanics below (triangulation, sprites, bootstrap/background batches) are **still used** — but now they run lazily inside `startAllmaps()` on zoom-in, not eagerly on activation.

When a user activated an IIIF layer (e.g. Gereduceerd Kadaster):

1. **Fetch geomaps bundle** (`GereduceerdeKadaster_geomaps.json`) — a compiled JSON containing all georeferenced map annotations (GCPs, resource URLs) for ~111 canvases
2. **Create `WarpedMapLayer`** — one shared Allmaps layer for all maps
3. **`addGeoreferencedMap(raw)`** — called per canvas (~111 times), feeds the GCP annotation to Allmaps. Allmaps parses it and builds a triangulation mesh (this is the expensive step)
4. **`addSprites(sprites, sheetUrl, sheetSize)`** — feeds a pre-packed sprite sheet (regular sprites: `sprites.jpg`) to Allmaps as a texture atlas. Instead of fetching IIIF tiles one-by-one from the image server, Allmaps samples the atlas. This was the first optimization.
5. Layer becomes visible

The loading happens in two phases for performance: a "bootstrap" batch (24 nearest maps to viewport, sequential) then a background batch (remaining, chunked 6 at a time). Both phases now live inside `startAllmaps()` and only run once zoomed in.

### The regular sprites

A texture atlas in Allmaps' internal format, declared per-layer in the geomaps bundle under `sprites.image` (atlas file) / `sprites.json` (manifest) / `sprites.imageSize`. Each entry maps a `canvasAllmapsId` to `{x, y, width, height, scaleFactor, spriteTileScale}`. `bundleLoader.ts` resolves these into a `spriteRef` per canvas and an `inlineSprites` list per manifest entry; `initialization.ts` groups them by target `WarpedMapLayer` and calls `addSprites(sprites, sheetUrl, sheetSize)` once per shared image. Allmaps uses this to sample pre-rendered thumbnail pixels instead of fetching IIIF tiles from the server. This solves the **IIIF server latency** bottleneck but does NOT solve the **triangulation** bottleneck. (When `spriteDebugMode` is on, the loader requests a `_debug` suffixed variant of the atlas image for visual debugging.)

---

## The bottleneck we are trying to solve

**Triangulation takes a long time.** On lower-end hardware, calling `addGeoreferencedMap` 111 times sequentially takes several seconds. The user sees a blank (or slowly filling) canvas until Allmaps has processed enough maps to cover the viewport.

The sprite atlas (`sprites.jpg`) helps quality (no slow tile fetches) but does not help initial display time because Allmaps still needs to triangulate before it can render anything.

---

## What we tried: gr_sprites

### Concept

Pre-warp each georeferenced canvas server-side using `gdalwarp -t_srs EPSG:3857` and pack the results into a sprite sheet (`gr_sprites.jpg`/`.webp`). Each tile is already rectified — pixels are in Web Mercator space, axis-aligned, north-up. Store the 4-corner WGS84 bounding box for each canvas in `gr_sprites.json`.

At render time, place each tile at its 4-corner geographic position. This requires zero triangulation.

### gr_sprites.json format

```json
{
  "spriteSheet": "gr_sprites.jpg",
  "canvases": {
    "<canvasHexId>": {
      "imageId": "https://iiif.../image-service-url",
      "x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 256, "height": 288,
      "coordinates": [
        [4.038, 51.042],
        [4.074, 51.042],
        [4.074, 51.016],
        [4.038, 51.016]
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

`coordinates` is `[NW, NE, SE, SW]`.

### Attempt 1: per-tile MapLibre image sources (superseded)

The first integration (`grSpritePlaceholder.ts`, function `addGrSpritePlaceholders`) cropped each tile out of the sheet via `OffscreenCanvas`, encoded it as a WebP blob, and added it as its own MapLibre native `image` source + `raster` layer (4-corner geographic placement, one source/layer pair per canvas).

Measured cost: **53 gr_sprites, plain crop + `addSource`/`addLayer` per tile ≈ 900ms** — too slow for an "instant" preview, and per-pixel black-background masking (see below) made it worse. `addGrSpritePlaceholders`/`removeAllGrSpritePlaceholders` are kept in `grSpritePlaceholder.ts` but are no longer called from `initialization.ts`.

### Attempt 2: single custom WebGL layer (current)

`grSpriteWebGLLayer.ts` implements `GrSpriteWebGLLayer`, a MapLibre `CustomLayerInterface` (`type: "custom"`, `renderingMode: "2d"`). This answers research question 5 below and is what's wired into `initialization.ts` today:

- One `fetch` + `createImageBitmap` for the **whole sprite sheet**, uploaded as a **single WebGL texture** (`onAdd`/`loadTextureAndBuildBuffer`).
- One vertex buffer holding two triangles (a quad) per canvas, positioned via `MercatorCoordinate.fromLngLat` on each canvas's `coordinates`, with UVs computed from that canvas's `{x, y, width, height}` within the sheet.
- `render()` does a single `drawArrays(TRIANGLES, ...)` call over the whole buffer — no per-tile draw calls, no per-tile sources/layers.
- Timing (`fetch` / `bitmap decode` / `buffer+texture upload` / total) is logged to the console (`[GrSpriteWebGL] ...`) on every load for ad-hoc profiling.

In `initialization.ts`, the layer group init order is now:
1. `WarpedMapLayer` is added first (bottom of stack, initially empty)
2. If the layer group has a `grSpritesPath`, `GrSpriteWebGLLayer` is added on top (masks the empty `WarpedMapLayer` while Allmaps loads underneath); its removal is registered via `runtime.activeLayerCleanup` in case the group is torn down mid-load
3. Normal Allmaps pipeline runs underneath (bootstrap batch, then chunked background batch, then regular sprites via `addSprites`)
4. When Allmaps finishes, the `GrSpriteWebGLLayer` is removed and the cleanup entry is cleared — `WarpedMapLayer` is now visible underneath

There's also a `grSpriteOnly` option on `initializeLayerGroup` that adds the WebGL placeholder layer and returns immediately, skipping the Allmaps pipeline entirely — used to benchmark the placeholder phase in isolation.

### Measured performance (current, WebGL layer)

Console output for the Gereduceerd Kadaster (111 tiles):

```
[GrSpriteWebGL] 111 tiles | fetch 611ms | bitmap 404ms | buffer+tex 0ms | total 1015ms
```

`buffer+tex` (vertex buffer build + texture upload) is effectively free. The cost is entirely **fetch** (611ms, network + server-side JPEG/WebP decode-ability of the sheet itself) and **bitmap decode** (404ms, `createImageBitmap` decoding the whole sheet in one shot). Neither scales with per-canvas count in the way Attempt 1's per-source approach did — but both scale with **sheet byte size / pixel count**, which grows with canvas count and resolution. Primitief Kadaster (452 canvases, 4096×15103 sheet) will be substantially worse on both axes since it's a much larger image to fetch and decode, not because of more `addLayer` calls.

This reframes the bottleneck: it's no longer "too many init calls" (solved by the single-texture approach) but "one very large image to fetch and decode," which is fundamentally a function of total pixel volume, not tile count.

### Two runtime optimizations applied on top of the WebGL layer

Neither preprocessing (below) nor GDAL is needed for these — they only change when/how existing network+decode work happens:

1. **Parallelize the load waterfall (`initialization.ts`)**: previously the gr_sprites manifest fetch only started *after* `await loadNewIiifEntries(...)` (the geomaps bundle fetch, which itself may do its own sequential regular-sprites-json fetch) fully resolved — a serial chain of up to 3 round trips before the sheet fetch even began. `layerInfo.grSpritesPath` is usually known synchronously from static layer config (set in `ArtemisApp.svelte`, matching `resolveGrSpritesPath`'s first-priority branch in `bundleLoader.ts`), so the gr_sprites manifest+sheet load now starts immediately alongside `loadNewIiifEntries` instead of after it. Falls back to the bundle-resolved path only if no static hint was available. Net effect: total time-to-preview becomes `max(bundle load, gr_sprites load)` instead of their sum.
2. **Cache the fetched sheet Blob across activations (`grSpriteWebGLLayer.ts`)**: toggling a layer off/on, revisiting a collection, or opening the same layer in a second compare-mode pane previously refetched and redecoded the whole sheet every time. The compressed `Blob` (not the decoded `ImageBitmap`, to keep memory bounded for large sheets like Primitief Kadaster's 4096×15103) is now cached per `sheetUrl` at module scope, so repeat loads skip the ~600ms fetch and pay only the `createImageBitmap` decode cost. The console log now appends `(cached)` to the fetch timing when this hits.

Neither change touches the underlying fetch+decode cost of a *first* load of a given sheet — that's still bound by sheet byte size/pixel count, which is what the tiled raster mosaic direction (above) targets.

### Accuracy

For the Gereduceerd Kadaster specifically (19th-century Belgian cadastral maps, consistent Lambert-like projection, rectilinear, low distortion), the 4-corner bilinear approximation is visually indistinguishable from Allmaps' dense mesh at overview zoom levels. The accuracy trade-off is acceptable for a preview.

### Data status

- `gr_sprites.json`/sheet coverage and ID alignment between `gr_sprites.json` canvas IDs and `canvasAllmapsId` are data-pipeline concerns (data lives in a separate repo), not part of the app code covered here — check the current bundle's `sprites.grJson` (or `IIIF/<mapId>/sprites/gr_sprites.json` convention in `bundleLoader.ts`'s `resolveGrSpritesPath`) for up-to-date coverage.

### Why the sheet needs an alpha channel

`gdalwarp` fills areas outside the source map boundary with black (NODATA = 0,0,0) when writing JPEG output, and JPEG has no alpha channel. The WebGL layer samples the sheet directly as a texture (no per-tile canvas compositing), so there is no render-time opportunity to mask out the black background — the sheet itself must already have transparent NODATA pixels (PNG or WebP with alpha) for tiles to blend correctly against whatever is underneath. This is a data-pipeline requirement now, not a render-time cost tradeoff.

---

## Current implementation: XYZ raster tiles (superseded gr_sprites/WebGL layer)

The gr_sprites/WebGL-atlas approach above (Attempts 1 & 2) has been fully replaced. The data pipeline now produces a conventional `gdal2tiles.py`-style XYZ/WebMercator tile pyramid per collection (mosaic all warped canvases into one georeferenced raster, then cut it into `{z}/{x}/{y}.webp` tiles, zoom 8–12), and the app consumes it with a **native MapLibre `raster` source** instead of any custom placeholder layer. `GrSpriteWebGLLayer` and `grSpritePlaceholder.ts` were deleted (no longer referenced anywhere).

### Data layout (data repo, `Artemis-RnD-Data`)

For each collection: `IIIF/<CollectionDir>/<tiles-dir>/{z}/{x}/{y}.webp` plus a `tiles_manifest.json` alongside it — a flat JSON array of every tile's relative path (e.g. `"10/522/341.webp"`), generated from the actual files on disk. This exists because coverage is an **irregular shape** (the real surveyed extent of Belgium, not a rectangle), so there's no way to derive the exact tile set from a bounding box without guessing and eating many spurious 404s.

Known pyramids as of this writing (directory names aren't a fixed convention — they vary per pipeline run, hence the explicit lookup table in code). The app serves the **full z8–12 range**; MapLibre requests only the handful of tiles intersecting the current viewport:
- `IIIF/GereduceerdeKadaster/Gereduceerd_Kadaster_tiles/` — 183 tiles total (z8–12), ~2.2MB
- `IIIF/PrimitiefKadaster/primitief_kadaster_tiles/` — 90 tiles total (z8–12), ~836KB

### Full zoom range (z8–12), uniform per collection

`KNOWN_TILE_DIRS` uses `minZoom: 8, maxZoom: 12` — everything the pipeline generates — identically for both collections (no per-layer pinning). This changed once the raster pyramid became the **persistent base renderer** rather than a transient placeholder: since Allmaps is now loaded lazily only on zoom-in (see "Lazy Allmaps" below), the pyramid must be sharp at whatever zoom the user is actually at, not a single overzoomed level. The full range costs nothing extra at render time because MapLibre requests only viewport-intersecting tiles on demand (and overzooms past z12 wherever the `WarpedMapLayer` above hasn't warped yet). An earlier iteration pinned this to z10-only to shrink a prewarm payload; that's obsolete now that prewarming is gone.

### App-side resolution (`bundleLoader.ts`)

`resolveTilesConfig(layerInfo)` resolves a `{ template, minZoom, maxZoom }` for a layer **synchronously from `layerInfo` alone** — no bundle/manifest fetch needed to know *where* the tiles are (unlike the old gr_sprites manifest fetch). Priority: `layerInfo.tilesPath`/`tilesMinZoom`/`tilesMaxZoom` explicit override, else a hardcoded `KNOWN_TILE_DIRS` lookup by `layerInfo.map` (mapId).

### Runtime rendering + lazy Allmaps (`initialization.ts`)

Per layer-group init:
1. `WarpedMapLayer` added first (initially empty). This is the group's top visual layer — Allmaps' full-res warp.
2. If `resolveTilesConfig` returns a config, `map.addSource(tilesSourceId, { type: "raster", … })` + `map.addLayer({ ..., paint: { "raster-opacity": 0.85 } }, warpedBaseLayerId)` — inserted with the `WarpedMapLayer` as `beforeId` so the raster sits **beneath** it (above the base map). **This z-order is critical:** the raster is the permanent *base*, not an overlay — if it went on top it would occlude the full-res IIIF with overzoomed z8–12 tiles (this was a real bug). Its layer id is `unshift`ed to the **front** of `layerIds` (bottom of the group's stack) so `reorderLayerGroups` keeps it below the warp. MapLibre lazily requests only the `{z}/{x}/{y}` tiles intersecting the viewport.
3. The geomaps bundle is still fetched eagerly (masks-click index by `sourceManifestUrl` depends on it), but the **expensive Allmaps pipeline is deferred**. It's wrapped in an idempotent `startAllmaps()` and only run when the map zoom reaches `ALLMAPS_TRIGGER_ZOOM` (**12.5**): if already zoomed in at activation (e.g. a deep-linked/persistent URL), it fires immediately; otherwise a one-shot `map.on("zoom", …)` listener arms it. Fire-and-forget either way — the raster base shows instantly and callers don't await triangulation.
4. `startAllmaps()` does **not** batch-load everything. It attaches a `moveend` listener and runs `reconcileViewport()` — see below. The raster tile layer is **never** auto-removed; it stays as the permanent base beneath the `WarpedMapLayer` for the group's whole lifetime.

Below `ALLMAPS_TRIGGER_ZOOM` the raster pyramid is the sole renderer — visually equivalent to Allmaps at overview zoom (the doc's earlier accuracy finding), but with zero triangulation cost. This means panning around at overview never pays the `addGeoreferencedMap` × N cost at all; it's incurred only when a user zooms in to read detail, and even then only for what's on screen.

### Viewport-driven Allmaps (Phase 1)

Once zoomed in, Allmaps loads **only the canvases in view**, not the whole collection — the win the doc's open questions kept circling (bounded CPU + memory, especially for the 455-canvas Primitief Kadaster). Mechanics, all in `initializeLayerGroup`'s closure:

- **Spatial index.** Each entry's geo bbox + center is precomputed once from its GCPs (`getEntryGeoBbox` / `getEntryGeoCenter`). No mask/tile query needed — a JS bbox test is used so we can include an off-screen **margin** (`ALLMAPS_VIEWPORT_MARGIN`, 0.5 → 2× linear), which `queryRenderedFeatures` couldn't (it only sees the current viewport).
- **`reconcileViewport()`** (run on start + every `moveend`): queue every not-yet-loaded entry whose bbox intersects the padded viewport, then kick the drainer. Guards: no-op if the group is parked/removed, or if zoom has dropped below the trigger (at overview a wide viewport would otherwise pull in everything).
- **`drainQueue()`** — a single drainer triangulates `RECONCILE_CHUNK` (6) entries per animation frame (`applyFetchedBatch(..., "parallel")` + `nextFrame()` yield), **re-sorting the queue by the current viewport center between chunks** so the nearest maps always load first even if the user keeps moving. The shared sprite atlas is uploaded once up front (`ensureSpritesUploaded`, mirroring the `addImageInfos` pattern) so every canvas samples it as soon as it's triangulated.
- **No eviction (Phase 1).** Loaded canvases are kept — `loadedKeys` guarantees each entry loads at most once, panning back is instant, and there's no add/remove churn. Memory grows only with the **area actually visited**, not the whole collection. (Eviction — hide/LRU via `removeGeoreferencedMapById` — is a deliberate Phase 2, added only if the step-log memory numbers demand it.)

Why this is cheap at runtime: canvases are added *inside* the one custom `WarpedMapLayer` (Allmaps' internal renderer), never as MapLibre style layers — so MapLibre sees no style churn, just a repaint request. And an already-loaded map only re-projects per frame (no re-triangulation), so pans stay smooth once loaded. Loading is driven off `moveend` (not `move`) and chunked with frame yields, so triangulation never lands mid-gesture.

**Teardown / toggle-off.** Because the raster base is permanent, its `activeLayerCleanup` entry now lives for the group's whole lifetime — which conveniently means `parkLayerGroup`'s existing `activeLayerCleanup.has(groupId)` check is *always* true for an IIIF group, so toggling one off **fully removes** it (base + meshes + masks + the `moveend`/zoom listeners, all unhooked in that one cleanup closure) rather than opacity-parking a now-permanent raster on screen. Re-show re-inits cheaply (bundle is cached; only the viewport re-triangulates). This is a fine trade *because* loading is viewport-bounded — parking to preserve meshes mattered when a toggle re-warped all 455; now it re-warps ~20.

This eliminates the entire "fetch+decode one big sheet" bottleneck that Attempts 1 & 2 were chasing — there's no sheet to fetch at all; MapLibre's own tile-request pipeline (caching, cancellation, viewport-driven prioritization) does the work at **per-tile** granularity — and it also defers the triangulation cost out of the common overview-browsing path entirely.

### Sprites vs. full-res IIIF (and the z-order lesson)

Two texture sources feed Allmaps and it's easy to confuse them when things look blurry:

- **The sprite atlas** (`sprites.jpg` — the regular one, *not* the deleted gr_sprites) is a coarse thumbnail sheet: e.g. Gereduceerd Kadaster packs 111 canvases into a 1024×1197 image → ~128×87px per canvas at `scaleFactor: 87.5` (≈1/87 of the 11200px originals). Fed via `addSprites`, it's what makes maps appear instantly. Allmaps is *designed* to upgrade: its renderer picks a tile zoom level per viewport (`getTileZoomLevelForScale`) and fires distinct events — `maptilesloadedfromsprites` (atlas) vs `maptileloaded` (real IIIF tile) — so once the viewport needs finer than the sprite's scale factor it fetches real tiles from the image service. The `iiif.ghentcdh.ugent.be/iiif/images/...` service is healthy (info.json 200, `access-control-allow-origin: *`, real JPEG tiles), so full-res *is* available.
- **The "we never see full-res IIIF" symptom was not a sprite problem** — it was a **z-order bug**: when the raster pyramid became a permanent base (Phase 1), it was initially still added *on top* of the `WarpedMapLayer`, so the overzoomed z8–12 raster (at `raster-opacity: 0.85`) painted over the full-res warp the whole time. Fixed by inserting the raster with the warped layer as `beforeId` (step 2 above). **Lesson:** if IIIF detail looks permanently soft, check layer stacking before suspecting the sprite/tile-upgrade path. There are two temporary diagnostics in `initialization.ts` for this — `DEBUG_SKIP_SPRITES` (force full-res by not feeding the atlas) and `DEBUG_LOG_TILE_SOURCE` (subscribe to the renderer's events and log real-vs-sprite tile counts per second) — both marked TEMP and off/removable once settled.

### No prewarming

There is no tile prewarming. The raster source's own viewport-driven fetching (a single HTTP/2 wave of the ~6–12 tiles covering the viewport, ~280ms, well inside the display budget) handles first activation, and the browser HTTP cache covers re-activations. An earlier `tilePrewarm.ts` fetched every z10 tile of every known pyramid at startup; it was removed because (a) with persistent/shareable URLs a layer can already be active on first load, so "warm before the user picks anything" doesn't hold, and gating warming on that would add exactly the kind of when-to-warm conditional we want to avoid, and (b) full prewarming doesn't scale past a handful of small collections (mobile data, wasted bandwidth for untouched collections). `listKnownTilePyramids()` was removed with it. (`tiles_manifest.json` is still used — by the tile protocol below — just not for prewarming.)

### Suppressing tile 404s: the `iiiftiles://` protocol (`tileProtocol.ts`, `mapInit.ts`)

Coverage is an **irregular shape**, so a plain `raster` source probes the full viewport grid and 404s on every tile outside the surveyed extent (e.g. `…/10/521/342.webp` → 404). Those 404s are harmless — MapLibre skips missing tiles — but the **browser logs every failed request natively**, flooding the console. Nothing in JS can suppress browser-level network logging, and a `map.on("error")` handler only silences MapLibre's *own* error objects, not the browser's request log. The only way to stop them is to **not make the request**.

The `iiiftiles://` custom MapLibre protocol does exactly that, using the `tiles_manifest.json` (flat list of the `z/x/y.webp` that actually exist) that already ships with each pyramid:

- `registerIiifTileProtocol()` adds the scheme once at module scope in `mapInit.ts` (beside the `pmtiles` registration).
- The raster source's tile template is wrapped with `toIiifTileTemplate(...)` → `iiiftiles://https://…/{z}/{x}/{y}.webp`.
- On each tile request the handler derives that pyramid's `tiles_manifest.json`, loads it once (cached per pyramid, shared across all its tiles — **not** tied to any single request's `AbortController`), and:
  - **not in the manifest →** returns a 1×1 transparent PNG locally. No HTTP request, no 404.
  - **in the manifest →** `fetch`es the real tile (browser HTTP cache still applies; the request's `AbortController.signal` is forwarded so MapLibre can cancel it).
  - **manifest unavailable →** fetches directly (best-effort); never breaks rendering.
- `prefetchIiifTileManifest(...)` is called the moment the raster source is added, so the manifest is warm before the first tile request and gating adds no first-paint latency.

This is **not** the old prewarming: it fetches one tiny index per pyramid, never tiles, and only ever *prevents* fetches. (A future alternative that removes even the manifest fetch: package the raster tiles as a `.pmtiles` archive, like the masks already are — the pmtiles protocol returns nothing for absent tiles with no per-tile request. That needs a data-pipeline change.)

Separately, `mapInit.ts` also installs a scoped `map.on("error")` that swallows tile-load errors for `iiif-tiles-source-*` sources (matched by source id, URL-pattern fallback) and re-logs everything else — so any residual MapLibre-level tile error (e.g. manifest miss during warm-up) doesn't spam the console either.

### Step logging (`initialization.ts`)

Every activation logs a `[IIIF <layer> · <pane>] <step> … Nms` timeline (monotonic `performance.now()` via `nowMs()`), so time-to-visible and each warp stage are profilable in the browser console without a debugger:

- `tiles: raster base added beneath warp (z8-12) +Nms` and `tiles: first tile painted Nms`
- `bundle: loaded N manifests / N canvases in Nms`
- `warp: deferred — armed zoom trigger at ≥ 12.5 …` **or** `warp: already at zoom … — starting viewport loading`
- `warp: start at zoom X — viewport-driven (margin 0.5×, N canvases available)` → `warp: viewport reconcile — queued N (loaded/total)` → `warp: sprite atlas uploaded Nms` → `warp: +N canvases Nms (M queued)` (one per drained chunk, repeating on each pan/zoom)

(The base-map zoom logger `[Artemis] pane=… zoom=… tileZ=…` in `ArtemisApp.svelte` is separate and still present. The old `[Artemis debug] …` overlay/click logs were removed.)

## Clickable canvas outlines: PMTiles vector masks (replaces live geoMask hit-testing)

Previously (see the earlier "how do we build the clickable outline" discussion), hover/click hit-testing was a JS point-in-polygon loop over every active canvas's `warpedMap.geoMask` (Allmaps' live triangulated geometry), rebuilding a GeoJSON hover source on every change. This has been replaced by pre-baked PMTiles vector tiles.

### Data (data repo)

`IIIF/<Collection>/<name>_masks.pmtiles` — one PMTiles archive per collection, single vector layer named `masks`, one polygon per canvas, with two properties: `manifestUrl` (the source IIIF manifest URL) and **`imageId`** (the per-canvas key, matching the sprite manifest's canvas key). Built with `tippecanoe -l masks -Z 8 -z 12`. `GereduceerdeKadaster` has 111 features, `PrimitiefKadaster` 455.

`imageId` exists because `manifestUrl` is **not unique per canvas** — a manifest can contain many canvases (up to 13 for Primitief Kadaster; 455 features but only ~166 distinct `manifestUrl`s). Resolving a click by `manifestUrl` alone would open the wrong canvas (always the manifest's first). `imageId` disambiguates to the exact clicked canvas.

### App-side (`bundleLoader.ts`, `runtime.ts`, `initialization.ts`)

- `resolveMasksPath(layerInfo)` — same override-then-known-mapId-lookup pattern as `resolveTilesConfig`/`resolveGrSpritesPath`.
- `mapInit.ts` registers the `pmtiles://` protocol once (`maplibregl.addProtocol("pmtiles", new PMTilesProtocol().tile)`, from the `pmtiles` npm package) so a `vector` source can reference an archive directly.
- Per layer group, `initialization.ts` adds one `vector` source + a single **invisible** `fill` layer (`fill-opacity: 0`), persistent for the group's whole lifetime — it exists purely so `queryRenderedFeatures` can hit-test it. Source/layer ids are fully deterministic from `groupId` (`getMaskLayerIds()` in `runtime.ts`), so creation, hit-testing, and teardown never need extra bookkeeping to find them.
- `runtime.ts`'s `removeLayerGroup` also removes the group's mask source (by deterministic id) on full teardown; the fill layer id rides along in the same `layerIds` array as the `WarpedMapLayer`, so park/restore/removal all work for free through existing machinery.
- Manifest info needed to open the viewer is indexed two ways, both populated directly from the geomaps bundle's parsed entries as soon as they load — independent of Allmaps triangulation, so hover/click work the instant a layer's masks source loads:
  - **`sourceManifestUrlToManifestInfo`** (`getManifestInfoForSourceManifestUrl`) — manifest-level fallback.
  - **`canvasKeyToManifestInfo`** (`getManifestInfoForCanvasKey`) — per-canvas, keyed by **both** a canvas's `canvasAllmapsId` and its `imageServiceUrl`. The mask's `imageId` is matched against this first, so a click resolves to the exact canvas and carries *that canvas's own* `imageServiceUrl`. Indexing under both identifiers means resolution succeeds whichever value the pipeline writes as `imageId` (the app can't see the pipeline's exact choice).
- **Click resolution** (`buildIiifInfoPanelItems` in `ArtemisApp.svelte`): resolve by `imageId` → `canvasKeyToManifestInfo` first; fall back to `manifestUrl` → `sourceManifestUrlToManifestInfo` only when the canvas key doesn't resolve (older mask data without `imageId`). The resolved canvas's `imageServiceUrl` is passed to `IiifViewer`, which uses it directly (`let serviceUrl = imageServiceUrl`) to open that exact canvas rather than resolving the manifest's first canvas.

### Hit-testing and hover outline (`ArtemisApp.svelte`, `mapInit.ts`)

`hitTestIiifMasks(map, point, paneId)` replaces `hitTestAllWarpedMaps`/`pointInPolygon`: it queries `queryRenderedFeatures` against every active group's (invisible) fill layer — native MapLibre spatial indexing instead of a JS loop over every canvas's polygon, so cost scales with what's near the cursor rather than total canvas count (see the earlier discussion of this tradeoff).

**Overlapping-feature bug and fix**: real cadastral coverage isn't disjoint (verzamelblad/index sheets cover many individual sheets) and vector-tile clipping can duplicate a feature near a tile boundary, so a query can return multiple raw hits at one cursor position. `hitTestIiifMasks` ranks all raw hits by bounding-box area (`geometryBboxArea`) and keeps only the smallest ("most specific" polygon), always returning at most one hit.

The first implementation then tried to draw the hover outline by `setFilter`-ing a shared vector `line` layer to `manifestUrl === <hit>`. **This was itself buggy**: `manifestUrl` is a per-*manifest* property, not per-*canvas*, and isn't unique — Gereduceerd Kadaster has 111 mask features but only 103 distinct `manifestUrl` values (some manifests have multiple canvases). Filtering by it highlighted every sibling canvas sharing a manifest, not just the one under the cursor — reproducing the exact "multiple canvases hovered" symptom the PMTiles switch was supposed to fix, just from a different cause than before. Fixed by dropping the filtered vector line layer entirely: `setIiifMaskHover()` (`mapInit.ts`) instead draws the hover outline from the **exact queried feature's own geometry** into a single shared GeoJSON source/layer (one feature at a time, always exactly the one hit), sidestepping the non-unique-property problem altogether.

**Stale-click bug**: after the above fix, hover correctly showed exactly one outline, but clicking sometimes opened a different canvas than the one under the cursor. Cause: the main/left pane's click handler reused `iiifHoveredMaps` — hover state set by the last *processed* `mousemove`, which is throttled to one update per `requestAnimationFrame` — instead of hit-testing at the click's own point. If a click landed in the same frame as an unprocessed mousemove, the reused state could be one frame stale. The right pane's click handler already called `hitTestIiifMasks(targetMap, e.point, 'right')` fresh; the left pane now does the same (`hitTestIiifMasks(map, e.point)`) instead of trusting `iiifHoveredMaps`.

## What we want

Near-instant initial display of all georeferenced maps when a layer is activated, followed by progressive quality improvement as Allmaps triangulates and loads full IIIF data.

Constraints:
- The data is served as static files from GitHub Pages (no server-side rendering)
- Must work in a browser (no Node, no GDAL at runtime)
- Must integrate with MapLibre GL JS and the existing Allmaps pipeline
- Initial display should appear in < 200ms ideally; < 500ms acceptable
- The full Allmaps rendering (with mesh warping) should replace the preview seamlessly

## Open research questions

> **Historical.** These questions were logged while exploring the gr_sprites / WebGL-atlas approaches and predate the current XYZ-raster-pyramid + lazy-Allmaps + `iiiftiles://` implementation. Most are now moot or answered by that rewrite (see the high-level overview and the sections above). References below to `GrSpriteWebGLLayer` / `gr_sprites` as "current production" are stale — those were deleted. Kept for provenance.

1. ~~Can 53+ MapLibre image sources be added in < 100ms?~~ Measured: no (~900ms for 53). Abandoned in favor of question 5's approach.

2. ~~Is there a way to use a single MapLibre source for the whole sprite sheet and render multiple regions from it?~~ Superseded by the WebGL approach (question 5) rather than answered via a native MapLibre source type.

3. **Can MapLibre render a spritesheet-backed layer without per-tile sources?** Something like a `fill-pattern` or `icon-image` approach adapted for large geographic rasters — not pursued once the WebGL layer worked.

4. **What is the fastest way to display N pre-warped geographic raster tiles in MapLibre?** Existing art from other map applications (e.g. OpenHistoricalMap, David Rumsey, etc.)? Partially answered: standard XYZ raster tile pyramids (native MapLibre `raster` source) are the conventional answer here — see "Next direction: tiled raster mosaic" below. Not yet implemented/measured against the current WebGL layer.

5. **WebGL custom layer approach — implemented.** `GrSpriteWebGLLayer` (`grSpriteWebGLLayer.ts`) loads the sprite sheet as a single texture once, then renders every tile as a textured quad at its correct 4-corner geographic coordinates in one `drawArrays` call. This is the current production approach. Remaining open item: no hard numbers yet on total time-to-visible for a full (111-canvas) sheet on low-end hardware — the console timing log exists but hasn't been systematically collected.

6. ~~Would a single large canvas source work?~~ Moot — the WebGL layer solves this without needing a single shared bounding box, since each quad gets its own 4 geographic corners.

7. **OffscreenCanvas in a Web Worker**: no longer relevant to the gr_sprite path (no per-tile crop/encode happens anymore), but still a live question for the *regular* Allmaps sprite pipeline if that ever becomes a bottleneck.

8. ~~Alternative to blob URLs~~ Moot for gr_sprites — the WebGL layer uploads the decoded `ImageBitmap` straight to a GPU texture via `texImage2D`, no blob URL round-trip.

New questions raised by the WebGL approach:

9. **Texture memory / size limits**: the whole sprite sheet is uploaded as one texture. For a full 111-canvas sheet (or multiple layers active at once), is there a risk of hitting `MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE` or excessive GPU memory use? Would tiling the sheet across multiple textures be needed at scale?

10. ~~**Opacity/z-order interaction with `WarpedMapLayer`**~~ **Resolved.** There is no longer a swap: the raster is a permanent base **beneath** the `WarpedMapLayer` (`raster-opacity: 0.85`), and Allmaps warps on top of it incrementally — no placeholder removal, no crossfade needed. (Getting the z-order wrong here was the real cause of the "never see full-res IIIF" bug — see "Sprites vs. full-res IIIF" above.)

11. **Tiled raster mosaic vs. single-texture atlas — which wins in practice?** The proposed tiled approach (see "Next direction" above) should reduce initial fetch/decode cost for large layers like Primitief Kadaster, but this is currently a hypothesis, not a measurement. Needs a prototype pipeline (mosaic + `gdal2tiles.py` or similar) and a side-by-side timing comparison against the current 111-tile / 1015ms baseline before committing.
